### What is RIX?

RIX is a search engine that uses AI. It is an AI search engine similar to the well-known Chat-GPT. <mark>Unlike chat-Gpt, this is designed especially for Developers only</mark>. RIX is developed by Hashnode and the team.

### Difference between traditional and AI search engines:

Traditional search engines like Google uses their search algorithm which works on analyzes the search query and matches it with indexed web pages based on keyword relevance, page ranking, and other factors. The search results are presented as a list of web pages that are deemed relevant to the search terms, typically displayed in order of perceived relevance. Users can click on the search results to access the respective web pages and find information related to their search query.

Whereas an AI search engine uses various AI techniques to search and present the most relevant and intended result. They can provide more accurate and personalized search results by learning from user interactions and historical data.

And unlike traditional it doesn't show many web pages and lets the user choose. Instead, it provides the most updated and accurate results for the user's search. It can optimize its result based on the user's needs.

### My RIX experience:

There are three modes to select and search:

1. Web search mode: Analyze the statement or link given and provide information about it.
    
2. Quick mode: Provides quick information.
    
3. Creator mode(Favourite): Provides a code according to your requirements.
    

### Creator mode:

To give it a try, I searched for a simple write `code for sum of n numbers in java.`

It provided me a relevant code on the side.

![First search](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687683615182/f8ec37e1-6c3e-479e-b59e-93d67a46bd57.png align="right")

Well I wasn't satisfied by the result because there is also a better-optimized way. So I typed in `optimized approach` It gave me my expected result which is a better one.

### Web search mode:

1. This came as a surprise to me. I gave a link to one of my previous blogs and it gave me a summary within a few seconds.

Then next I searched to `explain what is html` For which it provided a brief introduction to HTML.

But then I searched for `explain HTML for non-developers` for which it explained HTML differently.
