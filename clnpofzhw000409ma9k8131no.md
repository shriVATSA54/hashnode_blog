## Tips for Noobs(including me<sup>😶</sup>)

* ***<mark>Just start. As simple but most people won't start, so start you ahead of most people.</mark>***
    
    Choose a platform and Act now. I prefer Hashnode it's easy to begin and simple.
    
* **Patience is key 🙂**: At the beginning, your articles will suck. You will get no engagements to it. That's K and everyone should go through it. Be consistent.
    
* It's good to have low expectations from your side. Start small.
    

Quality is more important than Quantity. Also you don't want to end up feeling Burn out and end up hate Blogging.

> Less is more

* ### If your goal🎯 is to build a community overall then write in general and interact with them give them and fulfill their needs.
    

### or If you want to learn and have a small community of the same mindset people, then write on your niche. It can be something that you are currently learning and your journey. Like

1. If you reading Javascript then share about concepts that you read. Share your views about it.
    
2. <mark>Share the concepts that you felt were difficult and how you overcame them. Explain that concept and how you understood it at last.</mark>
    
3. Something like: 100Days0fCodingJourney, How I mastered Java etc.

### Some common questions🙋‍♂️🤔

* How can we stand out, since everyone has hundreds of articles already?
    
    Understand the coding community is always growing and there is always some new beginner and it will be relevant to them +
    
    Stick to your unique style and explain in your own way Slowly the readers will grow on your way.
    

What should be the end goal?

To provide value to readers and bring some clarity to their plate.

* Also. it's great if you have a strong reason Why are you doing this. Helps you keep motivated in the long run.
    
* If you want to get some opportunities or experience. Write on their product, community or repository if it's an Opensource project.
    
* In the worst case too you will end up Learning.
