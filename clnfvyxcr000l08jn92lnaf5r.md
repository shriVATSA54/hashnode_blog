# Intro:

Bonjour!!! I'm Shrivatsa, a Developer Student currently in my second year of studies. Recently, I received an email that introduced me to the Hashnode Bootcamp, I immediately registered for it.

As a student, we all seek guidance to excel as developers while enjoying the journey. This is precisely what I experienced during my time at the Hashnode Bootcamp, a 5-day event where numerous Co-founders, CTOs, and experts generously shared their valuable insights and guidance.

In the next few minutes, I'll be sharing my Hashnode experience, highlighting the key takeaways.
